my practicum project on bank loaners
The purpose of the project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. The hypothesis of the project is that a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. There can be other customers' characteristics that influence their abilyty to return a loan. The product's conclusions should help building credit score of a potential customer.
